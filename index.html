                    I have certificates in C (from
                    a <em>Dartmouth University</em> and <em>Institut Mines-Télécom</em> initiative), and C++
                    programming (from <em>LinkedIn Learning</em>). <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/michaellrowley/">(Certificates are on my LinkedIn profile.)</a>
                </br></br>
                    Completing virtual work experience placements at Thales and BAE Systems has given me
                    a variety of insight into the how the technology industry operates, what skills are invaluable
                    in certain sectors, and has also allowed me to vastly improve my teamworking and communication
                    skills.

                    Over the last three years, I have been discovering and disclosing security vulnerabilities
                    in a combination of open/closed-source software - these vulnerabilities have ranged from
                    <a href="https://huntr.dev/bounties/d4db0a12-184a-429b-8f76-a3cf8ae07dc3/">out-of-bound

                    latter two were reported via invite-only programmes and therefore I cannot link any report
                    or name the involved companies).

                    I'm extremely interested in low-level systems programming,
                    C++, C, C#, Python, and reverse engineering.

                    Facing problems in some of these areas has led to the development of numerous programs,
                    some of which have been released as open-source software:

                        <p>
                            A performant, secure <em>C++ library</em> which leverages the <em>boost.asio</em> framework
                            to deliver an object-oriented networking model that can easily be used by
                            other programs. This project was written in <em>C++ (17/20)</em> and is actively being used
                            in another personal project.

                        <p>
                            A simplistic UI-driven interpreter of a limited <em>ARM</em> subset.
                            Written in <em>C++</em> using the <em>Qt Framework</em> and designed with future
                            modularity in mind, making additions to the instruction-set much simpler.

                            Written in <em>C#</em> using the <em>.NET framework</em> and <em>WinForms</em> for the user-interface.

                        <p>
                            A <em>kernel-mode</em> antivirus driver which interacts with a user-interface to
                            detect malicious processes at runtime using heuristic and static detection
                            functionality. The driver was written in <em>C</em> using the <em>Kernel-Mode Driver Framework (KMDF)</em>
                            and the user-interface was written in <em>C++</em> using the <em>Qt Framework</em>.

                            of PNG image files and their comprising chunks. Written in <em>modern C</em> and

                        <p>
                            A <em>Python</em> script that enumerates over files or directories, printing the imports
                            of all executables that it finds. This script is currently configured to only search
                            for Windows drivers (using a <em>glob</em> query) but can easily be modified. A good
                            use-case for this script is to have a large directory of interesting drivers which the
                            script would then scan for interesting API imports (which depending on your classification of
                            'interesting', might range from <em>ExAllocatePool</em> to <em>DbgPrintEx</em>).
