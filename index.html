                <p style="margin-top: -30px;font-family: MontserratMedium, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">
                    I'm a student looking to pursue a career in joint cybersecurity and software engineering endeavours
                    in the future. With certificates in C and C++ software development from a joint <em>Dartmouth University</em>
                    and <em>Institut Mines-Télécom</em> initiative and <em>LinkedIn Learning</em>, respectively, I am also actively
                    looking to learn more about new and interesting technologies (and the ways that they can be broken).
                </p>

                <p style="font-family: MontserratMedium, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">
                    Over the last few years, I have discovered and disclosed a number of software security vulnerabilities
                    in a combination of open/closed-source software - these vulnerabilities have ranged from
                    buffer overflows in a kernel-mode driver to a trivial race condition in ticketing software,
                    to full authentication bypasses in a widely used financial platform.
                </p>
                <p style="font-family: MontserratMedium, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">
                    Increasingly, however, most of my focus has been towards reverse-engineering applications without the
                    intent of discovering security flaws in them, allowing a shift towards more binary-centred research that
                    has allowed me to develop a keen interest in reversing Windows drivers and desktop applications in general.
                    This research was conducted with the use of tools such as <a href="https://x64dbg.com/">x64dbg</a>,
                    <a href="https://ghidra-sre.org/">Ghidra</a>, <a href="https://hex-rays.com/ida-pro/">IDA Pro,
                    <a href="https://rizin.re/">Rizin</a> <a href="https://cutter.re/">Cutter</a> (formerly radare2, I believe),
                    and some attempts at using <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/debugger/debugger-download-tools">WinDbg</a>
                    (though I was unable to get everything working smoothly in a virtual machine).
                </p>
                <p style="font-family: MontserratMedium, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">
                    More recently, however, I have been developing a proxy system that makes use of post-quantum cryptographic primatives
                    (namely, <a href="https://pq-crystals.org/kyber/">'Kyber'</a> as proposed by the CRYSTALS group to a
                    <a href="https://csrc.nist.gov/Projects/Post-Quantum-Cryptography">NIST PQC project</a>) and other interesting techniques
                    to establish a degree of anonymity and message security over a peer-to-peer network.

                <p style="margin-top: -30px;font-family: MontserratMedium;">
                    I'm extremely interested in C++, C (especially kernel-mode programming on Windows), C#, Python, and reverse engineering projects in addition
                    to the odd bit of web development (HTML, CSS, and JavaScript) when it seems necessary (like this website).
                    Some of my interests have led to the development of personal projects to either solve issues or to teach me more about their fundamentals -
                    quite a few of those projects are now open-source and are available via GitHub:

                        <p>
                            A performant, secure <em>C++ library</em> which leverages the <em>boost.asio</em> framework
                            to deliver an object-oriented networking model that can easily be used by
                            other programs. This project was written in <em>C++ (17/20)</em> and is actively being used
                            in another personal project.

                            Written in <em>C++</em> using the <em>Qt Framework</em> and designed with future
                            modularity in mind, making additions to the instruction-set much simpler.

                            Written in <em>C#</em> using the <em>.NET framework</em> and <em>WinForms</em> for the user-interface.

                            of PNG image files and their comprising chunks. Written in <em>modern C</em> and
                            thoroughly tested using fuzzing (<em>AFL-Fuzz</em>) and a code assurance platform (<em>Codacy</em>).

                            of all executables that it finds. This script is currently configured to only search
                            for Windows drivers (using a <em>glob</em> query) but can easily be modified. A good
                            use-case for this script is to have a large directory of interesting drivers which the
                            script would then scan for interesting API imports (which depending on your classification of
                            'interesting', might range from <em>ExAllocatePool</em> to <em>DbgPrintEx</em>).
