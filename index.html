                <h2>Career</h2>
                <p style="margin-top: -30px;font-family: MontserratMedium;">
                    Right now, I am studying a number of A-Levels with the prospect of getting a degree after
                    finishing them.
                    I'm looking at undergraduate degrees in computer science and degree
                    apprenticeships in software engineering/cybersecurity but am being highly
                    selective about applying for the latter as I view apprenticeships as opportunities
                    to work my way up the ladder at organizations with whom I would like to pursue a
                    long-term career (in addition to gateways to real-world experience and recognised
                    qualifications).
                </br>
                    For this reason, I am only applying to companies that I am interested in and that have
                    fascinating work with possible continuing opportunities for personal development and progression.
                </br></br>
                    I have completed a number of formally recognized qualifications in advanced C programming (from
                    a <em>Dartmouth University</em> and <em>Institut Mines-Télécom</em> initiative) and C++
                    programming (from <em>LinkedIn Learning</em>). Links to the resulting certificates can be
                    found on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/michaellrowley/">my LinkedIn profile</a>.
                </br></br>
                    Completing virtual work experience placements at Thales and BAE Systems has given me
                    a variety of insight into the how the technology industry operates, what skills are invaluable
                    in certain sectors, and has also allowed me to vastly improve my teamworking and communication
                    skills.

                    Over the last three years, I have been discovering and disclosing security vulnerabilities
                    in a combination of open/closed-source code - these vulnerabilities have ranged from

                    MFA and primary authentication bypasses in a cryptocurrency platform's login page (the
                    latter two were reported via invite-only programmes and therefore I cannot link any report
                    or name the involved companies).

                <p style="margin-top: -30px;font-family: MontserratMedium;">
                    I'm extremely interested in low-level systems programming,
                    C++, C, C#, Python, and reverse engineering.
                </br>
                    Facing problems in some of these areas has led to the development of numerous programs,
                    some of which have been released as open-source software:

                        <p>
                            A simplistic UI-driven interpreter of a limited <em>ARM</em> subset.
                            Written in <em>C++</em> using the <em>Qt Framework</em> and designed with future
                            modularity in mind, making additions to the instruction-set much simpler.

                        <p>
                            A Windows tool for monitoring websites for source-level changes
                            in content, this project is configurable via regular expressions,
                            timeouts, custom user-agents, and exportable (encrypted) configuration files.
                            Written in <em>C#</em> using the <em>.NET framework</em> and <em>WinForms</em> for the user-interface.

                            A tool for obfuscating the hardcoded values of enumerations whilst
                            maintaining certain aspects (i.e, positive/negative evaluations which
                            are commonly used in conditional statements, etc.). Written in <em>C++</em> as a
                            console application.

                            of PNG image files and their comprising chunks. Written in <em>modern C</em> and
                            thoroughly tested using fuzzing (<em>AFL-Fuzz</em>) and a code assurance platform (<em>Codacy</em>).

                            A <em>Python</em> script that enumerates over files or directories, printing the imports
                            of all executables that it finds. This script is currently configured to only search
                            for Windows drivers (using a <em>glob</em> query) but can easily be modified. A good
                            use-case for this script is to have a large directory of interesting drivers which the
                            script would then scan for interesting API imports (which depending on your classification of
                            'interesting', might range from <em>ExAllocatePool</em> to <em>DbgPrintEx</em>).

                            A performant, secure <em>C++ library</em> which leverages the <em>boost.asio</em> framework
                            to deliver an object-oriented networking model that can easily be used by
                            other programs. This project was written in <em>C++ (17/20)</em> and is actively being used
